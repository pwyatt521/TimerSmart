# TimerSmart
Timer that is personalizable for studying, reading, working out, and events planned throughout the day.

# About
TimerSmart is a Digital Timer with personalizable sounds that signal the end of a time period.  The timer can be set to be:
1. a simple timer that emits an alarm and stops after an amount of time is completed.
2. a timer that emits short alarms at intervals and a longer alarm at the end of the time period
3. a day planner with an alarm at the end of each activities time frame that can be snoozed, pushing events later in the day back in time and subtracting time out of pre arranged free time in the day

# Mission
The mission of my app is to improve the users productivity throughout the whole day, or just during one activity at a time.
